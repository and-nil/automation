# automation

AppleScript to create a **hyperlinked text from a text selection in Safari** (or the page title if no text is selected), and put it on the clipboard. 

No formatting is added to the hyperlink, so it will be formatted according to the target app it is pasted into.

Useful for copying linked text to for example Evernote, OneNote etc.

For ease of use, assign it to a keyboard shortcut (e.g. Shift-Cmd-C). [FastScripts][fastscripts] is a good tool for this
